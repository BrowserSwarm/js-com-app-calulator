				<p>My collegiate Master's Thesis was titled <span class="italic">The Effects of Microblogging in the Classroom on Communication</span> (not the best title huh? haha oh well).</p>
				<p>This research aimed to determine if different mediums of communication (Twitter was used) could increase communication between students and their teachers and also amongst their fellow students.</p>
				<p>For this research I created a <a href="https://github.com/vernak2539/PHP-Communication-Apprehension-Calculator" target="_blank">shitty (now that I look back on it), quickly put together PHP app</a> to help me calculate this for all the students participating.</p>
				<p class="italic light-gray font2x">Since then...</p>
				<p>...I have been working on creating a <a href="https://github.com/vernak2539/js-com-app-calulator" target="_blank">simplified test, built completely in JavaScript</a>.</p>
